 Good evening
guys
Good evening
Hello
Do you choose the
Mr
Stage is all or not yet
Do they are anyone who

choose the team
Maybe to the
Let's go
Oh
so
Like sure
Today is a deadline
yeah
It's just a
By the way
by the way
do we have strict delays for homework
guys
No
isn't that strict because
No
no
no
it's not

did
Yeah
it was
By the
but 
would suggest to find at least like
10 to 15 minutes every day
How 
am because when it will come at the end
It will be like everything
you know
so at least I'm just trying to find 10 to 15 20 minutes doing doing like by small
small
small parts
Then 
think
I'm more from this course or
I'm others
Any 
think
Other courses

think they didn't give you homework yet
Yeah
they give
They gave
Data
Processing they gave it gave
He gave yesterday

think this file formats
I

yesterday

missed the classes
They will watch it
Hmm
Hey
yes
Chloe
darling
Hello
darling
All right

have a question
About the future
If you see
so today is a goal and Google introduced it quantum computers
Yeah
our second lesson you said that there is a problem with the model because they have a resource problem and what will be in the future about it because if Google
If we have they have a quantum computers

mean
they have a huge result results
And how they will
Yeah
so that's that's really good
It's interesting question

don't know how they work like only very general concept of these cubies

still
you know
I've been studying quantum physics in university
like at least one year
probably two years

can't remember
So a lot of electronics works on quantum effects
So for example
some
Some staff allows the electrons to jump the barrier
They like actually cannot jump
So they like tunneling through that
And no
no
it's like how it works
but it works and we use it in TVs and smartphones
Like some kind of some kind of magic
It's still 
think they should be some kind of scientific explanation that

don't know like how these quantum computers work

don't understand the concept of like something having the value of zero and one at the same time because
Like
okay
you can imagine that
but how about the storage
right
So if 
talk about like HD
or SSD
any storage
so you need to write it
And you need to like you should be able to read it in the future
And the most fear like two fears 
remember like from the community regarding quantum computers is
okay
if they are so like powerful and can make like much more like 
don't know
millions times
computations per second
So 
don't know about the encryption
right
So every say or any other encryption algorithm
So basically encryption works like modern encryption works on the very basic example
like
There are how how is called like one way function in mass

don't know how is in English
So so the way like it's it's very easy to calculate this
for example
it's very easy to multiply to prime integers and get the result
but it's super hard to understand like what
What are the integers you multiply it if you received like this result and

lot of encryption is based on that and actually Bitcoin is based on that so Bitcoin has several like Bitcoin has a lot of protocols inside like technologies and most of them like top tier encryption we have right now
So if Google can beat that so they can possibly like hijack all the new bitcoins
Maybe they can rewrite the whole Bitcoin like the whole blockchain like in a day and 
didn't know like still all the bitcoins from us

lot of like military applications like all this encryption and networking
So 
don't know it's technically possible that the such technology can can appear
but
Taking an account how much time and money and resources and smart people it takes to build such thing
So maybe the first country which builds it and you know like who creates some kind of like snow crash
Like from cyberpunk books

don't know so we'll see
At least like 
know like from from from what 
understand like 

history and technology history like all the new like top tier technologies they have like two applications like the two industries basically driving them fast in and like making them broadly available is
So this is like two things usually picking up the latest stage and trying to get like money of that and maybe one of them will pick it up

don't know maybe military first

think 
can see any applications of quantum stuff
But from personal perspective like being a human like 
don't know like 
see guys
Yeah that's interesting
but unless 
cannot benefit from that 
can as unless 
cannot earn money doing that
And it's inevitable for me like the sun the sun just can stop

don't know like okay
But example because the earth's rotates across the sun so the earth can just stop rotating and it will be infinite night for me

can't do anything about that 
can do anything about rain so what 
can this just to buy them braille or 
don't know prayed during steps sometimes
In case 
have the problem or some something 
cannot influence

think it's good not to worry about it
Because if you worry about something you cannot change that's bad
So you spent a lot of resources and the other example be nothing like for sure
So my plan is just read the news

don't know follow this agenda but don't worry about it
Okay
Yeah let's let's get down to business
So let me try to open my
Our schedule

have to reboot my B
today so 
lost this 
was pressured
Okay this one
Okay so the good news good news we are on track right and here
We're meeting number five so today we're going to discuss with the AP
and local installation
The bad news 
took a look at some of the frameworks like two or three maybe five but not like very very high level

like the blog posts you guys made so 
like the pictures and 
think 
will share some of my favorite pictures next time
So 
assume 
will need this weekend to check them and probably to add in the like set some marks or something like that
So just give me some time but 
haven't found any like critical problems there
Just remember to to share the workflow how you how you did that like for the first task
So 
need to see like what problems you've been using and don't forget about the pictures so the pictures are necessary for our blog post
So 
think we're going to focus on on that probably either on this lecture or this one
We're going to have time to review the homework
So what today we're going to discuss with this AP
and this is very
Let me show this slide
So here here are the slides for today
So what is the visper and why we discussing that so mostly when people discuss the generator for you or a general so if I'm focused on like LLAMs

know like a pilot's functions and stuff like that
So everything that works with text right because it has more application to the business when you work with text but still usually what is being forgotten is images and audio processing can't

got in the images

can't say this like easier to monetize this
So not to my business applications
So 
know a lot of

know a lot of cases where clients came to us like to come and ask to create something like 
don't know maybe a rate of over a hundred of cases
And only on this several them were related to image generation but some of them
Like more more this case more of these cases are related to audio and one of the usual like request is O
guys we have 5000 hours of recordings of 
don't know meetings or customers calling us for the support
So we need to understand this data right
So imagine you have a first line support like people calling like real users calling describing the issue and the operators are just sharing
So what what should you do to solve it and you need to control it somehow right so you need to see what are the most of the questions
So what are the answers is the client is happy or not right and for this case you need to voice processing and processing the voice is actually very old technology

don't remember how old it is but like two things here usually working is text to speech and speech to text and if we check 
didn't know like let's check
Asia or Texas Beach O
say yeah is patient all right 
got it everything is a yeah now let me check the pricing actually
Did he has pricing it's super cheap it's super cheap
O

think here
So this is O
free tier all right basically all right didn't need this one so speech to text so in order to transcript something like if you have a phone call real time transcription one dollar per hour that's too much
O
batch transcription so if 
have a lot of audio calls 
didn't know like one agreed 
can post them as a batch and this will result me in 80 cents per hour so not too much actually
Yeah as usually like Microsoft is like very complicated well very complicated stuff for billing so it's hot understand how much you will spend
And here is like the text of speech so basically to two directions like from speech you can extract text and from text you can generate speech right and this is like the standard voice 
think this standard voice become neural like during like last year because previously they had different
They had a different pricing like the standard voice is like this robotized voice usually here when you call a bank or something and neural voice is like more pleasant more realistically more naturally not on
So right now 
don't think 
should have some kind of like cheap voice like this old cheap voice probably it's inside the easy way studio but the trick is it's not expensive right so one billion characters is like
It's a lot
$15 for business it's like well not too much 
think so
And in case we have 1000 of like phone calls transcript it so it will result as is only like less than $200 so that's that's acceptable for that
And they definitely use machine learning there right so because there's no way programmatically like algorithmically to transcribe the speech
But still the interesting thing here is it's also possible to use machine learning techniques and all this concept of token we've been discussing previously right in working with speech in understanding this speech
And the project the project 
would like to show you this whisper so let me find it should be here in the notes 
put
Yeah this one
It wasn't introduced very similar once the child GP
arrived right so

just trying to recognize what was the time when charge it's your least okay
And chat

released
Okay November 30 all right 2022 yeah so they introduced this per like couple of months before charge it
And then what happens like do you remember this movie
Certains floor
This one
So do you know this movie
It's kind of like popular from scientific perspective but they they got the problem right so this is the cyber like not so cyberpunk but probably like
Interesting science fiction but take a look at the release years 1999 the problem is that in 1999 this movie gets out matrix
And that's why like everyone know about the matrix it was like very successful movie and this is the reason
Much more less people know that this movie for even exists
If they are all is it like a year previous before matrix so much more success on the same is the whisper right so
Charge it really is November 30 and this per actually the same company open here but it was not so hyped
In September as it become in November right
So what they introduced is they actually been working like at the same time looks like
They've been working at the visper and parallel like working with Shazup is right so
They reused the same like not the same but similar architecture like in quarters decoders and tokens to predict the tokens but not from
Text but from audio as well so they just take a look at the audio right and in the paper so they share like
This one so they took
680 thousand hours of multilingual audio so they sliced it in 30 seconds time like steps not steps but chunks and
The train the model the train the model against it using the same approach
The useful for the GP
so pretty the same like slice the data into some some samples
Try to predict the tokens like compare with the result learn train the model and so on so and this results in very interesting thing
Very high quality and 
don't know if there any model right now which can be it's equality of visper because once it was released it was like very high quality they released another model
Couple of months ago 
think it's called this but their protection seems to stay to stay the same so
And one more interesting thing here is it's completely open sourced so you can download it and it doesn't require a lot of VRA
to run so you can run it on the GP
you can run it a bit slower on the CP
and as far as it's like not large language model it will perform like with acceptable acceptable speed I've been running it at the CP
once and it works
Normally so not so slow as the L
so we are not so interested in technical details and 
don't understand them actually just
To explain to you but what we're interested in is actually we're interested in the result right so how it works and how 
can use it so how how to use it so you just install it as a python package but you need by touch and this is like why I

mentioned the PyTorch previously so in order to install it locally so you must have the PyTorch and
This is the command which should be a PyTorch
Download probably now come on where's download get started on here install okay like if you would like to try visper right or
In future if you would like to work with PyTorch so that's like two options here so it doesn't matter which version you will be installing you're going to see
The same table for every time like it's couple of years the same so
If installing it like in straightforward like recommended way like usually it's windows python package or people python and here is like kuda or CP
and depending on what you will select the UR
will be different right so kuda is the accelerated computing framework created by Nvidia as far as 
remember by Nvidia
To run the computations on the GP
and if you download and install this PyTorch you will be running everything against the GP
but if you do not have GP
right so you can install it without like just the CP
and it will be the same PyTorch it would work the same but much more slow right but it will still work so you need
So you need to prior to install the PyTorch so first you need to Python next you need to select the kuda version so usually the later the better you just copy this install and actually 
did that today because my PyTorch
Not PyTorch but visper failed to run today so I've been preparing to the demo and 
also have like the
Some files audio files so and the problem is why
Facing them and you may face the same so let me
Let me show you so the problem with python is that
Somehow like for for for modern applications 
use numpy version to so numpy is a framework is a library to working like with numbers in Python and it's required by PyTorch but this this PyTorch and it's like implementation in visper
It doesn't work with numpy 2.0.2 so it requires like old version and that's that's kind of problem you may face as well so what 
did is actually 
installed
Like virtual environments so 
created a virtual Python environment and downloaded once again PyTorch
visper and all the stuff so at least now it works right so that's that's the problem you may face with
So working with any software in Python at least 
think they should be some kind of work around but taking a look at how many people using the virtual environments 
think this is this is the acceptable work around so getting back here so what you need is just to install the library and that's it you can install it from source but 
prefer like this lazy option and
It also requires ff and pack so ff and pack
This is the most popular library to working with audio and video so and actually this may be useful for you in future so 
know like working in development or
Just processing media like audio and video requires you to convert files from one format to another split them 
don't know change the betrayed anything so everything can be done with the ff and pack but ff and pack is a common line interface like like it's a program which allows you to do everything but without the user interface without the U
but you can you can work with it programmatically so for example this is how you can convert from np4 to the
Maybe like the old format right and this is like the the greatest software and the fastest solution right now 
think so a lot of
Audio and video converting software use ff and pack and the hood so it will be necessary as well if you would like to start with whisper because whisper will need to transform the
Data from one format to another so for example in my example so i'm going to use mp3 but in some cases it may be one format or something like that so this can be to try to transform from one format to another and here are the models and languages so as far as it's machine learning model right so you can pick up any
Model and getting back here so remember we've been discussing this like model card
Quantization distillation and so on so different models right so this is like certain bill and model this is 70 billion model the same with whisper so this model has 39 million parameters it's tiny and it requires only one gigabyte of video RA
like VRA
and it's very fast right
So assuming the large model has like 1.5 billion parameters to occupy 10 gigabytes of VRA
and the speed is one like one 
right so this one is 10 times faster and turbo is 8 times faster and that's it they they have large V2 and large V3
And what's more interesting here is the quality so the quality here is measured in W.E
Air like world error rate so it just evaluating how much how many words like mispredicted like how many words are wrong and you can you can see the languages here so depending on the data set and probably the language structure
This really differs right so i'm not surprised the Spanish is the has like less errors than any other languages because Spanish at least from my perspective 
know like a couple of words and it's it looks like very easy language like straightforward and kind of easy
Yeah and some of the languages probably like in the presence in the internet will result in like half of the words misspelled like Belarusian 
don't know 
think 
need to 
know Belarusian language and 
think 
need to find some podcast in Belarusian and try to feed it into the whisper and check like it works but this someone strange because 42 out of 100 comparing
To six in Ukrainian so Belarusian Ukrainian super similar super similar so 
can understand like 90% of Ukrainian and Ukrainians understand 90% of Belarusian probably is the problem in the data set right
Okay but in case like in most cases we're going to work with English right so working with this language is super cool and a common line usage is pretty easy
So let's run the let's run the example and for the example 
have the

took the matrix movie and you know the like there is a scene
Agents meet a stock and was more fused

just let you just let you just
Agents meet his his delivering the speech about like the humans and not sure you will be able to
To hear it because I'm using teams in in browser so it's not desktop applications so 
can't share
My audio but here is like the agents meet is interrogating more feels and he's delivering the speech like 
got the idea so human beings are a virus and we like the agents are the cure so 
will drop you the link or you can just google it
And we consider this is 
picked this this sample because the like high quality speech and know any like music and background and something like that
So let me try to run this and check how to work so default
Whisperer
We just need to call whisper and pass the parameter as the data file so right now is detecting the language is in first 30 seconds and the language is detected to English
So you can do that actually mainly you can specify the language and here is the output right so this is like the Smith is fine
Discussing it this is very precise actually this is very precise 
think it's like
Probably here we have the problems
Yeah 
think it's missing it's missing something still but 
don't know what model I'm using so let me call the
The usage
Okay so a lot of things here so we are interested in the model so we can specify the model from here right so these are the available models 
don't know which one is the default maybe small or base so 
have a lot of 
ramp so 
can
Actually a large launch large model so let's try with probably another model and you can also specify the language explicitly 
don't think it will help us because it automatically recognize the business English one more thing actually very interesting thing you can do with this so here should be a parameter which is called prompt
Let me find it
Tress estimation okay model device output we're both
The should be parameter which is called something like a prompt
Yeah this one initial prompt so the trick is so by default it's now but let's get back to the idea so this per
So this per works with tokens right and everything like in this architecture you can you can pass the system message so you can pass the system message and whisper
I've been working once on English transcription task so we decided to make
To transcribe the English assessments and other company so there is like an interview asking questions and the person replying and one of the idea was to calculate the

don't know how it's called like the words like when the person is thinking like parasite words so it's not possible to do with just playing with her hardly possible but if you explicitly provide them in a prompt it will recognize them and also a lot of a lot of times in this dialogue they were mentioned to a company name e palm and
There is no such word in in whisper data set so that's why
It was looking for similar but if you provide it in initial prompt and it will like see this the same token combination it will just do not search for any other alternative so this is very powerful thing like I'm very underrated okay so let's get back here and let's try the model let me try different models and
We're gonna see the performance like this speed let's try with tiny smallest model and let's check how fast to work pretty fast and let me try
Okay pretty fast as well 
don't see a big difference in speed here right at least this sample the sample is only one minute
No okay yeah the final token was took the time and let me try large
So the large should give us the highest quality
Okay yeah you see the difference so large and turbo
There's the tiny so the tiny you you can just understand what's what's going on in this discussion so if you don't care about particular worlds if you just would like 
don't know
To summarize it in future and make some decision like 
don't know sentiment analysis something so maybe tiny is okay but still
That's that's a lot of questions as far as 
see
But here the turbo and large so they work very effectively
Alright so and once 
run every model so it's getting downloaded so 
don't think 
started small so probably it will be downloading right now
No no it's already downloaded 
think yeah so once 
selected large first time it started downloading all of this model like one and a half gigabytes of model locally
So if you have a lot of files 
didn't know million of hours so what you just need

just need a P
so you can use it in cloud right so let's check the pricing opening a call

pay pricing so you can do that with AP
let me scroll to the whisper
Fintany and create time systems
Okay images audio models okay so what we're going to pay we're going to pay 0.16 cents per minute so let's let me calculate one hour
So 0.16 cents per minute so it means one hour will cost us 36 cents yeah so it means like 100 hours of transcription will result in 36 dollars
So this should be some point where it's cheaper to purchase hardware and run it on your hardware and save the hardware for yourself instead of sending to the to the open the yeah right
Yeah so in some cases it's more effective to do it on your own machine 
didn't like spend the night
Recreate some Python scripts and yeah regarding Python you can call it from Python as well so it's Python library so you can you can use it from command line but you can also here is the command I'm using
It can also import it load the model and transcribe your own data just passing is the reference to the to the file right and here are the examples how we can do that with
Despite them still it has one problem which probably be solved in some forks of the whisper like whisper 
and so on the problem is it doesn't differentiate speakers so you will not see the difference between speaker one speaker to write so what 
did in homework 
shared the file with you where the there is a difference between speaker one
And speaker to so here is no no any difference but the output formers maybe different right so let me call the help once again
Here output format you can see we have a lot of different output formats TX
VT
SRTT
V
zone all let's try
Let's try to run with all but probably all is a default right so let me share
Okay yeah all is a default it means 
already have all this information available so let's let's check it out if you like 
zones you can run this
Look before might it very good right.
