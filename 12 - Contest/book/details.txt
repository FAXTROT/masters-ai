Book: Why nations fail ?

Create a dramatic and thought-provoking book cover illustration for the nonfiction book 'Why Nations Fail.' The scene should depict a stark contrast between wealth and poverty under a bright, clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds. In the upper half of the image, showcase a futuristic cityscape of towering, sleek skyscrapers made of glass and steel, reflecting the sunlight with a golden hue, symbolizing wealth and modernity. These skyscrapers should have clean lines, modern architecture, and a sense of opulence, with small details like helicopters flying nearby or lush rooftop gardens. In the lower half of the image, portray a gritty, overcrowded concrete jungle representing poverty, with crumbling, densely packed buildings made of worn concrete, covered in graffiti, and surrounded by narrow, littered streets. Add small details like laundry lines hanging between buildings, street vendors with carts, and people in tattered clothing walking through the shadows to emphasize the struggle. The ground should have a grayish, dusty tone, contrasting with the vibrant sky above. In the center of the image, overlay the title 'WHY NATIONS FAIL' in bold, capital letters using a modern, sans-serif font with a slight distressed texture, colored in a deep red or black to stand out against the background. Ensure the title is large and commanding, spanning across both the rich and poor sections to symbolize the divide. Add subtle symbolic elements, like a cracked flagpole or a faded national emblem in the background, to hint at the theme of failing nations. The overall mood should be intense and reflective, with a cinematic quality, using sharp contrasts in lightingâ€”bright sunlight illuminating the skyscrapers and darker shadows in slums below.
